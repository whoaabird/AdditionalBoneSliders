# AdditionalBoneSliders
AdditionalBoneSliders is a mod for Honey Select that adds sliders to the in-game GUI for editing characters with Additional Bone Modifier data


## Currently highly experimental
**Make sure to backup any files before use(!)**. Consider this project to be in _pre-alpha; a prototype_

## Major issues
There is yet no functionality that interacts with character Save, meaning that all **_changes that made are permanent and written immediately_**
Backup your character and bonemod.txt files(!)

## Prerequisites
This mod is made for use with IPA (https://github.com/Eusth/IPA) and the mod Additional Bone Modifiers

## Usage
Backup your character and bonemod.txt files already(!)
Build the project and install with IPA. 
Start character customization mode and Load a character with an associated bonemod.txt file
Additional sliders for bones are added to the sub menu _Advanced Body Adjustments_
Each slider will adjust the scale value its bone
Pressing the [Def] button will revert a value to what it was when the character was loaded
